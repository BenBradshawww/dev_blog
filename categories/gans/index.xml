The generator takes random noise as input and outputs a generated image. The discriminator takes both a generated image and a real image as inputs and tries to determine which is real and which is generated. Their training process can be likened to a ping-pong game, with the generator trying to produce images that fool the discriminator, and the discriminator is trying to identify which images are generated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
