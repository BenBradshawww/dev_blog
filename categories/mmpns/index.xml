With the ever growing use of GNNs, this has naturally led to the questions about the use of GNNs within the medical sector. More specifically, the question of using GNNs to predict the properties of molecules was brought up. Back in the early 2010s, this idea was in its infancy with few successful applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
