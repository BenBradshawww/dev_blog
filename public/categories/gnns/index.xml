With the ever growing use of GNNs, this has naturally led to the questions about the use of GNNs within the medical sector. More specifically, the question of using GNNs to predict the properties of molecules was brought up. Back in the early 2010s, this idea was in its infancy with few successful applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, one growing limitation of these graphs are the amount of computational resources they require with some large-scale graphs having millions of nodes each with their own set of features and their set of edges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has led to the creation of graph embedding methods, more specifically the deep embedding methods. These embedding methods aim to create a high-quality representation of the nodes and their edges. Rather than just incorporating the graph structural information into an embedding, these methods also include node and edges features and other hierarchical information. This results in a complicated model which are able to learn very rich representations of nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
